    q: "What is MuScriptor?",
    a: "MuScriptor is an audio to MIDI converter: you give it a recording and it transcribes the notes played by every instrument into MIDI. It was developed by [Kyutai](https://kyutai.org/) and [Mirelo](https://mirelo.ai/).",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it free to use?",
    a: "Yes. This demo is free, the code is MIT-licensed, and the model weights are published on HuggingFace under CC BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial use). If you want to run it locally, check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/muscriptor/muscriptor).",
  },
  {
    q: "What audio formats can I upload?",
    a: "MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AIFF, or Opus. Drop the file on the page or use the file picker.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which instruments can it transcribe?",
    a: "Voice, piano, guitars, bass, strings, brass, woodwinds, drums and many more. To improve accuracy, you can also tell it up front which instruments to expect. See the dropdown in the instrument selection for the full list. ",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I convert a song to sheet music with it?",
    a: "Indirectly: MuScriptor outputs MIDI, which you can open in MuseScore, Logic, Ableton, Guitar Pro or any notation editor and export as a score. MuScriptor transcribes pitch, onset and offset timing per instrument.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run it locally or use it from Python?",
    a: "Yes. `uvx muscriptor serve` runs this same web UI on your machine, `uvx muscriptor transcribe song.mp3` does it from the command line, and the Python API is a couple of lines. It runs on NVIDIA GPUs, on Apple Silicon via Metal, and on CPU with the small model. [Setup instructions are on GitHub](https://github.com/muscriptor/muscriptor).",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate is it?",
    a: "It's the strongest open transcription model we know of, but it is not perfect. Expect a very good starting point that you clean up in a DAW. MuScriptor tends to work better on acoustic and guitar music than electronic music. If you'd like a more exact benchmark, [check out the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.08168).",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to the audio I upload?",
    a: "It's transcribed on the server and not kept afterwards. If you'd rather it never leaves your machine, [run MuScriptor locally](https://github.com/muscriptor/muscriptor).",
  },
  {
    q: "How does it work, technically?",
    a: "MuScriptor is a decoder-only transformer that reads the audio in 5-second chunks and generates a token stream describing note onsets, offsets and instruments, which is then assembled into MIDI. A major reason why it works so well is the dataset: MuScriptor is trained on 170k songs spanning classical music to heavy metal. [Read more in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.08168).",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I report a bug or send feedback?",
    a: "Please [email us](mailto:muscriptor@kyutai.org) or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/muscriptor/muscriptor/issues/new/choose).",
